Notes for next time

An object containing the functions and variables that control the flow of the game.

What will be in this object:
- gameReset()
- requestName()

Problem from last time: 
gameBoardArray was not updating, suspected that the const gameBoardReset was not taking effect. Used an explicit definition, not sure if it fixed it. Check next time.

A display at the top for prompts.
A visual gameboard that players can click to mark.

An interface on the left and right to allow players to enter their name, the data gets sent when you press the start button.

One button for starting and restarting the game, directly below the board.
A display below that button for results.
