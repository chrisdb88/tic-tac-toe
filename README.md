Notes for next time

An object containing the functions and variables that control the flow of the game.

What will be in this object:
- gameReset()
- requestName()

Problem from last time: 
gameBoardArray was not updating, suspected that the const gameBoardReset was not taking effect. Used an explicit definition, not sure if it fixed it. Check next time.
